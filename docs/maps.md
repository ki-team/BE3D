# Map System

There are two types of maps in this engine.
.bmt - Breaker Map Text - an Uncompiled BreakerMap
.bm  - Breaker Map		- A Compiled Breaker Map

BMT files are just Text data, therefore Easy to Save, edit, and Modify without BMEdit.exe
BM are Compiled to Binary Data, Therefore Not.
When you save a file in BMEdit.exe, It is saved as a BMT file, However if you export that file, It is in a BM File
BM Files take up less Storage but cannot be modified after Compilation (at least easily)
